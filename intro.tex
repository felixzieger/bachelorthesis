\section{Introduction}
The aim of this thesis is to show the connection between the $2$-dimensional cohomology group of a group $\Pi$ over an abelian group $A$ and group extensions of $A$ by $\Pi$.
Furthermore the $n$-dimensional cohomology group of a group $\Pi$ with coefficients in an abelian group $A$ is shown to be a special case of $\Ext{n}_R$ with $R=\mathbb{Z}(\Pi)$ the group ring.

The thesis closely follows \textcite{maclane}.
